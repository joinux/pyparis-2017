## Sheer El Showk: Building a high-performance, scalable ML & NLP platform with Python

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
Python is the de-facto language for natural language processing (NLP) but scalability and performance bring their own unique challenges.  In this talk I will outline the architecture and tools we used to build a production grade, scalable platform providing highly customizable NLP services. 

</div>

**Speaker**: Sheer El Showk (Lore Ai)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
As mentioned above I am currently the CTO and co-founder of Lore Ai, a US/France-based startup providing natural language products for business intelligence.

Before founding Lore Ai, I was a theoretical physicist working on both string theory and statistical physics.  I've held research positions at CEA Saclay, CERN and I now hold a permanent research position at UPMC, Paris 6 (from which I'm on leave).  Part of my research required the development of novel linear optimization algorithms.  I also implemented these in Python/Cython and built a parallelized version to run at scale on clusters with hundreds of cores (our computations often required dozens of core-years).  The algorithms and methods I developed led to order-of-magnitude improvement in state-of-the-art results in important and long-standing theoretical physics problems (the Ising model).  My publications can be found [here](https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=a+el-showk&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d).

I am a very practiced speaker with extensive speaking experience.  I have given over 50 academic seminars at universities all over the world including Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, and Cambridge, among others.  I have also given several longer workshop style talks at international conferences as well as shorter invited talks at large prestigious conferences.  I was an invited speaker at Strings 2015, the largest annual conference of the international String theory community (video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHCuaB2zlIQ)).

## chticode@univ-lille1.fr: How to make teenage girls love coding using Python and the visual arts-oriented language Processing ?

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
Too few women work in IT. It's a pity as it deprives women of exciting jobs and computing of women viewpoint. So, members of Lille University decided to fight prejudices by making female computer science students teach coding to teenage girls, using Python and the visual arts language Processing.
</div>

**Speaker**: chticode@univ-lille1.fr (Informatique au fénimin, Lille University)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
Chti'code is a collective of 3 faculty members, Maude Pupin, Philippe Marquet and Yann Secq, teaching computer science at Lille University. They are all implied in popular science. For example, Yann Secq initiate teaching of coding for primary school pupils by computer science students ; Philippe Marquet argues for the teaching of coding from primary school in France and Maude Pupin promotes computer science for teenagers and, especially for girls with _informatique au féminin_ collective.


Together, they initiate _L codent, L créent_ activity to :
- introduce and demystify coding
- prove that coding is accessible to any women
- illustrate the creative power of coding in an artistic context
- and, ideally, arouse vocations when orientation choices are made
