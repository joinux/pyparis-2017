# About the PyParis Conference

<a id="mission"></a>
## Mission

The PyParis conference is a gathering of users and developers of the
Python programming language.

The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts
a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to
apply the language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast
realm of application development, scientific computing, data analytics,
education, cloud, devops...

We aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with
tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners,
and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in
person.

A major goal of our conference is to provide a venue
for users across all the various domains where Python is currently used to share
their experiences and their techniques, as well as highlight the
triumphs and potential pitfalls of using Python for certain kinds of
problems.


PyParis 2017 is organized by <a href="http://www.systematic-paris-region.org/">Systematic Paris
Region</a>, with the generous help and support of our sponsors.

If you would like to
volunteer to be a part of the PyParis team, contact us at:
