## Boris FELD: Unicode and bytes demystified

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
Unicode and bytes were hard to work with in Python 2, luckily Python 3 came and put some order in this bazar. Alas the old habits die hard and migrating from Python 2 to Python 3 can often be hard without understanding all the concepts. Let's review them for a happy Python 3 migration in 2017!
</div>

**Speaker**: Boris FELD ()

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
I've given several talks already which are available here: https://speakerdeck.com/lothiraldan, several of them were in English.

## Burkhard Kloss: Performant Python

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
Python is a great language. Easy to learn, friendly, widely used. 
Not, however, fast.
Usually this doesn’t matter. But when it matters, it *really* matters!

How do we make our Python fast enough - but still keep it readable?

</div>

**Speaker**: Burkhard Kloss (Applied Numerical Research Labs)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
I only came to England to walk the Pennine Way… 25 years later I still haven’t done it. I did, though, get round to starting an AI company (spectacularly unsuccessful), joining another startup long before it was cool, learning C++, and spending a lot of time on trading floors building systems for complex derivatives. Sometimes hands on, sometimes managing people. Somewhere along the way I realised you can do cool stuff quickly in Python, and I’ve never lost my fascination with making machines smarter.

I've held research positions at CEA Saclay, CERN and I now hold a permanent research position at UPMC, Paris 6 (from which I'm on leave).  Part of my research required the development of novel linear optimization algorithms.  I also implemented these in Python/Cython and built a parallelized version to run at scale on clusters with hundreds of cores (our computations often required dozens of core-years).  The algorithms and methods I developed led to order-of-magnitude improvement in state-of-the-art results in important and long-standing theoretical physics problems (the Ising model).  My publications can be found [here](https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=a+el-showk&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d).

I am a very practiced speaker with extensive speaking experience.  I have given over 50 academic seminars at universities all over the world including Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, and Cambridge, among others.  I have also given several longer workshop style talks at international conferences as well as shorter invited talks at large prestigious conferences.

## Venkat Raghav Rajagopalan: Introduction to pomegranate

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
pomegranate is a python module for probabilistic modelling focusing on both ease of use and speed, beating out competitors in benchmarks. In this talk I will describe how to use pomegranate to simply create sophisticated hidden Markov models, Bayesian Networks, General Mixture Models (and more!).
</div>

**Speaker**: Venkat Raghav Rajagopalan (Telecom Paristech)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
I am a research engineer affiliated with Telecom Paristech, currently working from INRIA, Saclay under the Guidance of Dr. Alexandre Gramfort.

I work on tree based methods of scikit-learn. Myself and Jacob collaborate a lot on the tree code base of scikit-learn. He introduced me to pomegranate. I've also closely followed the recent GMM overhaul of scikit-learn, which was done by our other scikit-learn developer Thierry.

I would like to say people should listen to me because I have an h-index of over 200, can code in assembly, play in a rock band, know what "One Direction" is, have the best sense of humor but unfortunately none of these are true (evidently especially the last one ;( )

But I can promise to work on making the talk lively and interesting, with guidance from Jacob... :)

## chticode@univ-lille1.fr: How to make teenage girls love coding using Python and the visual arts-oriented language Processing ?

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
Too few women work in IT. It's a pity as it deprives women of exciting jobs and computing of women viewpoint. So, members of Lille University decided to fight prejudices by making female computer science students teach coding to teenage girls, using Python and the visual arts language Processing.
</div>

**Speaker**: chticode@univ-lille1.fr (Informatique au fénimin, Lille University)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
Chti'code is a collective of 3 faculty members, Maude Pupin, Philippe Marquet and Yann Secq, teaching computer science at Lille University. They are all implied in popular science. For example, Yann Secq initiate teaching of coding for primary school pupils by computer science students ; Philippe Marquet argues for the teaching of coding from primary school in France and Maude Pupin promotes computer science for teenagers and, especially for girls with _informatique au féminin_ collective.


Together, they initiate _L codent, L créent_ activity to :
- introduce and demystify coding
- prove that coding is accessible to any women
- illustrate the creative power of coding in an artistic context
- and, ideally, arouse vocations when orientation choices are made

## nicolas.chauvat@logilab.fr: Serve an Hypermedia API using CubicWeb-JSONSchema

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
Ever complained that you had to write client code specific to each RESTful APIs you use even though the services are similar ?

Come learn about the use of HTTP, JSON Schema Hypermedia and JSON-LD to write more generic clients that do not depend on the specific URL scheme of an API.
