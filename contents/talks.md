## Burkhard Kloss: Performant Python

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
Python is a great language. Easy to learn, friendly, widely used. 
Not, however, fast.
Usually this doesn’t matter. But when it matters, it *really* matters!

How do we make our Python fast enough - but still keep it readable?

</div>

**Speaker**: Burkhard Kloss (Applied Numerical Research Labs)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
I only came to England to walk the Pennine Way… 25 years later I still haven’t done it. I did, though, get round to starting an AI company (spectacularly unsuccessful), joining another startup long before it was cool, learning C++, and spending a lot of time on trading floors building systems for complex derivatives. Sometimes hands on, sometimes managing people. Somewhere along the way I realised you can do cool stuff quickly in Python, and I’ve never lost my fascination with making machines smarter.
