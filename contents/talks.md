Before founding Lore Ai, I was a theoretical physicist working on both string theory and statistical physics.  I've held research positions at CEA Saclay, CERN and I now hold a permanent research position at UPMC, Paris 6 (from which I'm on leave).  Part of my research required the development of novel linear optimization algorithms.  I also implemented these in Python/Cython and built a parallelized version to run at scale on clusters with hundreds of cores (our computations often required dozens of core-years).  The algorithms and methods I developed led to order-of-magnitude improvement in state-of-the-art results in important and long-standing theoretical physics problems (the Ising model).  My publications can be found [here](https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=a+el-showk&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d).

I am a very practiced speaker with extensive speaking experience.  I have given over 50 academic seminars at universities all over the world including Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, and Cambridge, among others.  I have also given several longer workshop style talks at international conferences as well as shorter invited talks at large prestigious conferences.  I was an invited speaker at Strings 2015, the largest annual conference of the international String theory community (video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHCuaB2zlIQ)).

## Sylvain Zimmer: Developer-friendly task queues: what we learned building MRQ

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
MRQ is a gevent-based task queue, built with performance and developer productivity in mind. I will explain why we migrated away from Celery and then from RQ, explore some the unique features of MRQ and discuss the tradeoffs we made while designing it.

## Thomas Moreau: Robustifying `concurrent.futures`

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
This talk presents in details `concurrent.futures` and its drawbacks. Then, it introduces [`loky`](https://github.com/tomMoral/loky), a library that robustifies
`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`, and some of the major design choices.
</div>

**Speaker**: Thomas Moreau (CMLA - ENS Paris Saclay)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
I am a PhD student at Centre de Mathématiques et de leurs applications (CMLA), ENS Paris-Saclay, since Fall 2014. My PhD subject is *Automatic feature extraction for physiological time series*. My research interests touch several areas of Machine Learning, Signal Processing and High-Dimensional Statistics. In particular, I am working on Convolutional Dictionary Learning, studying both their computational aspects and their possible application to pattern analysis. I am also studying on theoretical properties of learned optimization algorithms and their links to deep learning.

I have been experimenting with different tools for parallel and distributed computation, from standard libraries like python multiprocessing to more advance tools such as CUDA or openMPI. I have been working on [`loky`](https://github.com/tomMoral/loky) and the robustification of `concurrent.futures` for the past 2 years in collaboration with Olivier Grisel.

## Vaibhav Singh: Machine Learning to moderate ads in real world classified's business

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
In this talk we share our experiences on how we at OLX Berlin built machine learning models to moderate 100+ million classified ads every month. Audience will get a chance to experience a real world of content moderation and a race to beat online fraudsters and scammers.
</div>

**Speaker**: Vaibhav Singh (OLX Naspers Services GmbH)

## Venkat Raghav Rajagopalan: Introduction to pomegranate

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
pomegranate is a python module for probabilistic modelling focusing on both ease of use and speed, beating out competitors in benchmarks. In this talk I will describe how to use pomegranate to simply create sophisticated hidden Markov models, Bayesian Networks, General Mixture Models (and more!).
</div>

**Speaker**: Venkat Raghav Rajagopalan (Telecom Paristech)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
I am a research engineer affiliated with Telecom Paristech, currently working from INRIA, Saclay under the Guidance of Dr. Alexandre Gramfort.

I work on tree based methods of scikit-learn. Myself and Jacob collaborate a lot on the tree code base of scikit-learn. He introduced me to pomegranate. I've also closely followed the recent GMM overhaul of scikit-learn, which was done by our other scikit-learn developer Thierry.

I would like to say people should listen to me because I have an h-index of over 200, can code in assembly, play in a rock band, know what "One Direction" is, have the best sense of humor but unfortunately none of these are true (evidently especially the last one ;( )

But I can promise to work on making the talk lively and interesting, with guidance from Jacob... :)

## chticode@univ-lille1.fr: How to make teenage girls love coding using Python and the visual arts-oriented language Processing ?

**Abstract**:

<div class='talk-abstract'>
Too few women work in IT. It's a pity as it deprives women of exciting jobs and computing of women viewpoint. So, members of Lille University decided to fight prejudices by making female computer science students teach coding to teenage girls, using Python and the visual arts language Processing.
</div>

**Speaker**: chticode@univ-lille1.fr (Informatique au fénimin, Lille University)

**Speaker bio**:

<div class='talk-bio'>
Chti'code is a collective of 3 faculty members, Maude Pupin, Philippe Marquet and Yann Secq, teaching computer science at Lille University. They are all implied in popular science. For example, Yann Secq initiate teaching of coding for primary school pupils by computer science students ; Philippe Marquet argues for the teaching of coding from primary school in France and Maude Pupin promotes computer science for teenagers and, especially for girls with _informatique au féminin_ collective.


Together, they initiate _L codent, L créent_ activity to :
- introduce and demystify coding
- prove that coding is accessible to any women
- illustrate the creative power of coding in an artistic context
- and, ideally, arouse vocations when orientation choices are made
