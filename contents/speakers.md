### Philippe BOULANGER (Manager d'expertise C/C++ Python, INVIVOO)

I ran into Computer science when I was eleven after reading an article "Turing computer" and buying a programmable calculator. When I was 15, I sold my first programs to other students and I acted that « from a passion I will do my job ». After being graduated in engineering school ENSEEIHT with a DEA in "fundamental computer science and parallel computing", open-minded, I always questioned myself without hesitation to exit from my comfort area to discover new functional worlds and learn new skills: from CAD programming, to numeric simulation (car crash-test) then in embedded software, until 2007 where I joined the financial companies. Some crisis after, I'm always working in that domain which allows him to work with the last tools, having technical challenges with the opportunity to provide innovating solutions. I joined Invivoo in 2017 to develop the two expertises « Python programming » and « C/C++ programming ». My objective consists to integrate a quant team in the not so distant future....
