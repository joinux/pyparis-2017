# CFP

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>
We’ve reopened the CFP for 6 more days.
<p>

<p>
We’re specially looking for more proposals in the **Education**, **Core Python** and **Web / Cloud / Apps tracks**.
</p>
</div>

The event brings together developers, engineers, data analysts, scientists, educators, systems architects and others from the Python community to discuss new techniques and tools that will make their work more enjoyable.

Presentation content can be at a **novice**, **intermediate** or **advanced** level.

Talks will run **40 min** and experience reports 15 minutes, unless you have a lot to say. We may also accept shorter talks (15 minutes), lightning talks (5 minutes) and roundtable proposals.

We're also looking for **tutorials** (90 minutes to 180 minutes).

As a reminder, PyParis presentations are intended to share knowledge and experience. We welcome talks letting attendees know how you are using tools in your work, but discourage any proposals with the aim of selling a product.

Note that we expect all the talks to be delivered in English, with, maybe exceptions for the education track.

If you are interested in presenting a talk, experience report or roundtable, please submit a short abstract and bio. To see the type of topics presented at previous PyParis events (aka PyData Paris), please look at our past conference site or check out the videos on YouTube.
